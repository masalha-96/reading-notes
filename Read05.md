# Comparison operators:  

## 1 :: Evaluating Conditions

   * **IS EQUAL TO (==)**
    >> **The equality operator (==) checks whether its two operands are equal in value only, returning a Boolean result.**

--------------
--------------

   * **IS NOT EQUAL TO(!=)**
    >> **The inequality operator (!=) checks whether its two operands are not equal, returning a Boolean result.**

--------------
--------------
 

* **STRICT EQUAL TO(===)**
   >> **The strict equality operator (===) checks whether its two operands are equal in value and have the same data types, returning a Boolean result.**
--------------
--------------
* **STRICT NOT EQUAL TO (!==)**
   >> **The strict inequality operator (!==) checks whether its two operands are not equal, returning a Boolean result.**
--------------
--------------

* **GREATER THAT (>)**
   >> **The greater than operator (>) returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand, and false otherwise.**

--------------
--------------

* **LESS THAN (<)**
  >> **The less than operator (<) returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand, and false otherwise.**

--------------
--------------

* **GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO (>=)**
   >> **The greater than or equal operator (>=) returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand, and false otherwise.**
--------------
--------------
* **LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO (<=)**
     >> **The less than or equal operator (<=) returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand, and false otherwise**
--------------

## 2 :: LOGICAL OPERATORS

* **LOGICAL AND (&&)**
>> The logical AND (&&) operator (logical conjunction) for a set of operands is true if and only if all of its operands are true. It is typically used with Boolean (logical) values. When it is, it returns a Boolean value.


* **LOGICAL OR (||)**
>> The logical OR (||) operator (logical disjunction) for a set of operands is true if and only if one or more of its operands is true. It is typically used with Boolean (logical) values. When it is, it returns a Boolean value.



* **LOGICAL NOT (!)**
>> The logical NOT (!) operator (logical complement, negation) takes truth to falsity and vice versa. It is typically used with Boolean (logical) values. 



## 3:: LOOPING

![] (https://i.ibb.co/q5WdBk3/temp.png)

* The first time the loop is run, the variable i (teh counter) is assigned a value of zero.

(i'll finsish it later).
