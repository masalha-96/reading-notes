## What is a growth mindset for me?
It is the mentality that believes in **( developing / acquiring )** any skill over time and that it can control that through perseverance and hard work. 

## 3 reminders to myself of how to keep myself in a growth mindset:
* *No life with despair, no despair with life.*
* *He who doesn't make mistakes doesn't learn.*
* *Pain that doesn't break you, makes you stronger.*
