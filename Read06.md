# Programming With JS

* What Is a Script
    * a Script Is a Series of Instructions

* Writing a Script
  * to Write a Script, You Need to First State Your Goal and Then List the Tasks That Need to Be Completed in Order to Achieve It.


**Start** With the Big Picture of What You Want to Achieve, and Break That Down Into Smaller Steps.
[1]  Define the Goal
[2]  Design the Script
[3]  Code Each Step

## Operators

### 1. Assignment Operators
**<!> Used to Assign a Value of the Right Operand to Its Left Operand in Js Using These Assignment Operators.**

### 2. Comparison Operators
<<<<<<< HEAD
** <!>  Used to Compare Variables and Take Some Action Based on the Result of That Comparison. **
** <!> the Javascript Comparison Operators Compare Two Operands Value and Return the Result in Boolean ( True or False). **

## What Is a Function?
**<!> Functions Let You Group a Series of Statements Together to Perform a Specific Task ( One Code X Many Time.**

---
### [1] Creat a Function 
We Can Create It in Two Different Ways :

**`1. Function Declaration`**
Function Declaration: Starts With **"function"**

function getInfo() {
   Lines of Code; 
   }
  

**`2. Function Expression`**

Function Expression: Starts With **"var varName"**

Var varName = function getInfo() {
   Lines of Code;
   }

---


### [2] Calling  a Function 
Simply You Can Call It Like This - **functionName();**
* **without Parameters** for Ex: getInfo**( )**;
  * Often This Type Contains Input by the User / or Displaying Something on the Screen.
* with **parameters** for Ex: calcArea**(width,height)**;
* with **arguments** for Ex: getArea**(12,8);**
