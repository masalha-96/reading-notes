# What I learned about HTML & CSS:

## < HTML > 

* ### DOCTYPEs
Because there have been
several versions of HTML, each
web page should begin with a
DOCTYPE declaration to tell a
browser which version of HTML
the page is using

     for HTML5 we use <!DOCTYPE html>*

* ###  Comments on HTML

        <!-- comment goes here -->

* ###  Block elements

         <h1>Sohaib Msalha</h1> 

        <9> Sohaib Msalha </p

         <!-- <ul>
          <li>Science: 21 Nov - 20 Feb 2010/11</li>
         <li>Architecture: 6 Mar - 15 May 2011</li>
         <li>History: 29 May - 21 Aug 2011</li>
         <li>Religion: 28 Aug - 6 Nov 2011</li>
        </ul> -->
