# An Intro to Git
## What is Git?
### *It is an application without a user interface commonly used by programmers to save their files and use them at any time and any place very easily, and it is definitely popular because it avoids losing your files and it has a local database so you can work on it without an internet connection, It's installed by default on Mac, and can be installed easily on Windows. Git manages all of your files in a specified directory, and keeps track of when changes are made to them.*
