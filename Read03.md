* ### What is HTML?
*HTML* stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. *HTML* is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. *HTML* describes the structure of a Web page. *HTML* consists of a series of elements. *HTML* elements tell the browser how to display the content.


* ### DOCTYPEs
DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.

     for HTML5 we use <!DOCTYPE html>

* ###  COMMENTS on HTML

        <!-- comment goes here -->

* ###  ID ATTRIBUTE

        Every HTML element can carry
        the id attribute. It is used to
        uniquely identify that element
        from other elements on the page.

        for Ex; <p id="boldP">...<p>

        
* ###  ClASS ATTRIBUTE

      Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute

        for Ex; <p class="important">...<p>

* ###  BLOCK Elements

         <h1> Sohaib Msalha </h1> 

        <p> Sohaib Msalha </p>

         <ul>
          <li> Science: 21 Nov - 20 Feb 2010/11   </li>
          <li> Architecture: 6 Mar - 15 May 2011  </li>
          <li> History: 29 May - 21 Aug 2011      </li>
          <li> Religion: 28 Aug - 6 Nov 2011      </li>
        </ul> 

* ### INLINE Elements

         Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their 
         neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements.
         Examples of inline elements are
         - <b>  To make Text bold, Ex <b> Hello </b>
         - <em> To make Text italic, Ex <em> Hello </em>
         - <a>
         - <img>.

* ###  Grouping Text & Elements In a Block
        - The <div> element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.
        - The <span> element acts like an inline equivalent of the <div> element. 
        - The <iframe> element is like a little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window    you can see another page. 
           


* ###  Escape characters
      are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.
      for Ex; © == &copy;
