# What I learned about HTML 2day:

* ### What is HTML?
*HTML* stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. *HTML* is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. *HTML* describes the structure of a Web page. *HTML* consists of a series of elements. *HTML* elements tell the browser how to display the content.

Three| HTML5 Layout




# ChapterOne :: `Structure`

* ### html tag
     * The <html> tag represents the root of an HTML document.
  * The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> tag).


* ### body tag
  * The <body> tag defines the document's body.
  * The <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
   * *Note*: There can only be **one** <body> element in an HTML document.


* ### head tag
  * The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.
   - Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
   - Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
   - Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.


* ### title tag
   - The title tag defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
   - The title tag is required in HTML documents!

# ChapterTwo :: `Extra Markup`
  
* ### DOCTYPEs
  * DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.

  `for HTML5 we use <!DOCTYPE html>`

  -------------------------------


* ###  COMMENTS on HTML

        <!-- comment goes here -->

  -------------------------------
* ###  ID ATTRIBUTE

        Every HTML element can carry
        the id attribute. It is used to
        uniquely identify that element
        from other elements on the page.
        for Ex; <p id="boldP">...<p>

        
  -------------------------------
* ###  ClASS ATTRIBUTE

      Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute
        for Ex; <p class="important">...<p>


  -------------------------------
* ###  BLOCK And INLINE Elements

> #### BLOCK ELEMENTS

         <h1> Sohaib Msalha </h1> 

        <p> Sohaib Msalha </p>

         <ul>
          <li> Science: 21 Nov - 20 Feb 2010/11   </li>
          <li> Architecture: 6 Mar - 15 May 2011  </li>
          <li> History: 29 May - 21 Aug 2011      </li>
          <li> Religion: 28 Aug - 6 Nov 2011      </li>
        </ul> 


   > #### INLINE ELEMENTS

 

         Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their 
         neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements.
         Examples of inline elements are
         - <b>  To make Text bold, Ex <b> Hello </b>
         - <em> To make Text italic, Ex <em> Hello </em>
         - <a>
         - <img>.

  -------------------------------
* ###  Grouping Text & Elements In a Block
        - The <div> element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.
        - The <span> element acts like an inline equivalent of the <div> element. 
        - The <iframe> element is like a little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window    you can see another page. 
           

  -------------------------------

* ###  Escape characters
      are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.
      for Ex; © == &copy;
