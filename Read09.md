## The Command Line

The command line is a text interface for your computer. It’s a program that takes in commands, which it passes on to the computer’s operating system to run.
From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer, just as you would with Windows Explorer on Windows or Finder on Mac OS. The difference is that the command line is fully text-based.
Here’s an appendix of commonly used commands.

**Commands :**

cd
$* cd Desktop/*

cd takes a directory name as an argument, and switches into that directory.


cd ..
*$ cd ..*

To move up one directory, use cd ... Here, cd .. navigates up from jan/memory/ to jan/




## Basic Navigation!


In this section, we'll learn the basics of moving around the system. Many tasks rely on being able to get to, or reference the correct location in the system. As such, this stuff really forms the foundation of being able to work effectively in Linux. Make sure you understand it well.

The first command we are going to learn is pwd which stands for Print Working Directory. (You'll find that a lot of commands in linux are named as an abbreviation of a word or words describing them. This makes it easier to remember them.) The command does just that. It tells you what your current or present working directory is. Give it a try now.
