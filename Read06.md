# Programming With Js 

* What Is a Script
    * a Script Is a Series of Instructions

---

* Writing a Script
  * to Write a Script, You Need to First State Your Goal and Then List the Tasks That Need to Be Completed in Order to Achieve It.


**Start** With the Big Picture of What You Want to Achieve, and Break That Down Into Smaller Steps.
[1]  Define the Goal
[2]  Design the Script
[3]  Code Each Step

## Expressions 
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions.

## OPERATORS
1. ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS 
2. COMPARISON OPERATORS
3. ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
4. LOGICAL OPERATORS
5. STRING OPERATOR


## Operators
### 1. Assignment Operators
<!> Used to Assign a Value of the Right Operand to Its Left Operand in Js Using These Assignment Operators.

### 2. Comparison Operators
** <!>  Used to Compare Variables and Take Some Action Based on the Result of That Comparison. **

## What Is a Function?
** <!> Functions Let You Group a Series of Statements Together to Perform a Specific Task ( One Code X Many Time. **

---
### [1] Creat a Function 
We Can Create It in Two Different Ways :

**`1. Function Declaration`**
Function Declaration: Starts With **"function"**

function getInfo() {
   Lines of Code; 
   }
  

**`2. Function Expression`**

Function Expression: Starts With **"var varName"**

Var varName = function getInfo() {
   Lines of Code;
   }

---


### [2] Calling  a Function 
Simply You Can Call It Like This - **functionName();**
* **without Parameters** for Ex: getInfo**( )**;
  * Often This Type Contains Input by the User / or Displaying Something on the Screen.
* with **parameters** for Ex: calcArea**(width,height)**;
* with **arguments** for Ex: getArea**(12,8);**
