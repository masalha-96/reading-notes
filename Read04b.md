# How Computers Work?


## **1 :: What makes a computer, a computer**

 4 Main Parts of any Computer

2- STORAGE 
3- PROCESSING 
4- OUTPUT

## **2 :: Binary & Data**
All operations within a computer can be represented as 0/1 or on/off 
through the Binary language.

## **3 ::  Circuits and Logic**
Computer circuits are binary in concept, having only two possible states. They use on-off switches (transistors) that are electrically opened and closed in nanoseconds and picoseconds (billionths and trillionths of a second). A computer's speed of operation depends on the design of its circuitry.

## **4  CPU, Memory, Input & Output** 
- INPUT : 
   - CONVERTS PHYSICAL INPUT TO BINARY INFORMATION.
- MEMORY : 
    - STORES INFORMATION.
- CPU : 
    - CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT CALCULATES INFORMATION. (Arithmetic and Logical)
- OUTPUT: 
   - CONVERTS INFORMATION TO PHYSICAL OUTPUT. 

---------------------------------------------


## **5 :: Hardware and Software** 
- Hardware:
  - Hardware refers to the physical elements of a computer. This is also sometime called the machinery or the equipment of the computer. Examples of hardware in a computer are the keyboard, the monitor, the mouse and the central processing unit(CPU).


- Software:
    - Software,commonly known as programs or apps, consists of all the instructions that tell the hardware how to perform a task. These instructions come from a software developer in the form that will be accepted by the platform (operating system + CPU) that they are based on.
